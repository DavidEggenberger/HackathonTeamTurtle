# HackathonTeamTurtle

TeamTurtle strives to be an inclusive learning platform! People can learn new things by working through learningpaths. Logged in users (GitHub, Google, Discord) can also create learningpaths for the community. A learningpath consists of links to blog articles and videos. The learningpath is created through a drag/drop configurator. When an enrolled user of a learningpath has a question he/she can use the chat function (SignalR) to chat with others that are enrolled in the same learningpath.
